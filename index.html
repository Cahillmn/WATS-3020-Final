      <!-- first panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Sporting</div>
      <div class="acc-body">Breeds in the Sporting Group were bred to assist hunters in the capture and retrieval
        of feathered game. Retrievers, built for swimming, specialize on waterfowl, while the hunting grounds of
        setters, spaniels, and pointing breeds are grasslands where quail, pheasant, and other game birds nest.
        Many Sporting Group breeds possess thick, water-repellant coats resistant to harsh hunting conditions.

      <div class="acc-header">Herding</div>
      <div class="acc-body">The Herding Group comprises breeds developed for moving livestock, including sheep,
        cattle, and even reindeer. Herding dogs work closely with their human shepherds, and their natural
        intelligence and responsiveness makes them highly trainable. Today, some Herding breeds, such as the
        German Shepherd Dog, are commonly trained for police work. The high levels of energy found in Herding
        Group breeds means finding them a job is recommended, lest they begin herding your children at home.

    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <!-- third panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Hound</div>
      <div class="acc-body">All breeds in the Hound Group were bred to pursue warm-blooded quarry. The sleek,
        long-legged sighthounds use explosive speed and wide vision to chase swift prey, like jackrabbits and
        antelope, while tough, durable scenthounds rely on their powerful noses to trail anything from raccoons
        to escaped convicts. Members of the Hound Group possess strong prey drives and often will stop at
        nothing to catch their quarries.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <!-- fourth panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Working</div>
      <div class="acc-body">Breeds in the Working Group are dogkind’s punch-the-clock, blue-collar workers, and
        the group includes some of the world’s most ancient breeds. They were developed to assist humans in some
        capacity – including pulling sleds and carts, guarding flocks and homes, and protecting their families –
        and many of these breeds are still used as working dogs today. Breeds in the Working Group tend to be
        known for imposing stature, strength, and intelligence.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <!-- fifth panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Terrier</div>
      <div class="acc-body">The feisty, short-legged breeds in the Terrier Group were first bred to go underground
        in pursuit of rodents and other vermin. Long-legged terrier breeds dig out varmints rather than
        burrowing in after them, while the group’s “bully” breeds, created long ago for ghastly pursuits like
        bull-baiting, are popular companion dogs today. Breeds in the Terrier Group are excellent competitors in
        the sport of Earthdog.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <!-- sixth panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Toy</div>
      <div class="acc-body">The diminutive breeds of the Toy Group come in enough coat types and colors to satisfy
        nearly any preference, but all are small enough to fit comfortably in the lap of their adored humans. In
        a way, toys dogs are their own version of working dogs: they work hard at being attentive, affectionate
        companions. Breeds in the Toy Group are popular with city dwellers, as their small size makes them a
        good fit for smaller yards or apartments.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <!-- seventh panel -->
      <div class="acc-header">Non-Sporting</div>
      <div class="acc-body">The breeds of the Non-Sporting Group have two things in common: wet noses and four
        legs. After that, there’s not much shared by this patchwork group of breeds whose job descriptions defy
        categorization in the six other groups, though they all have fascinating histories. Today, the varied
        breeds of the Non-Sporting Group are largely sought after as companion animals, as they were all
        developed to interact with people in some capacity.</div>
